# V_EditorClassic

This is a simple pre-Windows 11 notepad clone written in .NET 2.0. To use this program, you need to have .NET 2.0 installed.

## Features

- Simple notes taking (not like Windows 11's Notepad)
- Automatically sets the current date as the default file name
- Wider file type support
- Wider operating system support (Windows 11 - Windows 98 if .NET 2.0 is installed)

### Operating System Support

I tested these OSs with V_EditorClassic. Everything in between should be working too.

- Windows 11 - 7 (Automatic Install of .NET 2.0)
- Windows XP (Manual installation of .NET 2.0 is needed and only the portable version works)
- Windows 98 (Manual installation of Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, .NET 2.0 for Windows 98 is needed and only the portable version works)

Windows 95 should work too if using MattKC's dotnet9x backport project for .NET 2.0-3.5
